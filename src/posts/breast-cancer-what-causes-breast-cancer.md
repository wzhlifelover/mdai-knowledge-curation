* We don’t know what causes each case of breast cancer. But we do know many of the risk factors for these cancers (see Lifestyle-related Breast Cancer Risk Factors and Breast Cancer Risk Factors You Cannot Change). For example, lifestyle-related risk factors, such as what you eat and how much you exercise, can increase your chance of developing breast cancer, but it’s not yet known exactly how some of these risk factors cause normal cells to become cancer. Hormones also seem to play a role in many cases of breast cancer, but just how this happens is not fully understood.
* We do know that normal breast cells can become cancer because of changes or mutations in genes. But only about 1 in 10 breast cancers (10%) are linked with known abnormal genes that are passed on from parents (inherited). Many genes have not yet been discovered, so women with a family history of breast cancer might have inherited an abnormal gene that doesn't show on a genetic test. Most breast cancers (about 90%) develop from acquired (not inherited) gene changes that have not yet been identified. 
* How gene changes can lead to breast cancer
* Genes control how our cells function. They are made up of a chemical called DNA, which comes from both our parents. DNA affects more than just how we look; it also can influence our risk for developing certain diseases, including some kinds of cancer.
* Normal cells have genes called proto-oncogenes, which help control when the cells grow, divide to make new cells, or stay alive. If a proto-oncogene is mutated (changed) in a certain way, it becomes an oncogene. Cells that have these mutated oncogenes can become cancer.
