To determine how advanced your cancer is and to create the most effective treatment plan, we do something called “staging the cancer.” For most types of cancer, we use guidelines from the American Joint Commission on Cancer. But for liver cancer, we use the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer staging system. This system, created by Mount Sinai Liver Cancer Research Director [Josep Llovet, MD](https://www.mountsinai.org/profiles/josep-llovet), and colleagues, is used throughout the United States and Europe. The chart below outlines the four classes of liver cancer, tumor size, and survival estimates.


<table>
  <tr>
   <td>Class
   </td>
   <td>Size/Extent
   </td>
   <td>Treatment Option
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>0
   </td>
   <td>&lt;2 cm 
   </td>
   <td>Cure is possible
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>A
   </td>
   <td>1 tumor any size or 2-3 tumors all ≤ 3 cm Confined to liver
   </td>
   <td>Cure is possible
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>B
   </td>
   <td>2-3 tumors > 3 cm or 4 or more tumors confined to liver
   </td>
   <td>Cure is less likely, but we can usually control the cancer for several years *
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>C
   </td>
   <td>Invaded blood vessels or spread beyond the liver
   </td>
   <td>Treatment is possible *
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>D
   </td>
   <td>Same as C but patient cannot tolerate treatment
   </td>
   <td>Supportive care is recommended
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>


* Some patients even with very advanced liver cancer can now be cured with immunotherapy.
